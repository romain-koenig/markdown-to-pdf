			<p>Welcome to my pet project, the Markdown to PDF Converter.
				This project was born out of my passion for learning and my desire to deepen my understanding of React and GitHub Pages.
				It represents 24 hours, from idea to MVP, of coding, and debugging – all with the aim to create a useful tool (at least for myself) and improve my development skills.
				As you explore this app, please handle it with care.
				Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as they contribute to my learning process.
				Enjoy converting your Markdown to PDF, and thank you for being a part of this!</p>
